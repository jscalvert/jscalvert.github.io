      <title>Random Markov chains have simple stationary distributions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The stationary distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain is generally a complicated function of its transition rates. However, if the rates are i.i.d. random variables whose common distribution satisfies certain tail conditions, then the stationary distribution is essentially a simple function of the exit rates out of each state.  This is the main result of a new preprint with Frank den Hollander and Dana Randall, which generalizes and makes a precise prediction by Chvykov et al. (2021) and settles a question raised by Bordenave, Caputo and Chafa√Ø (2012) under certain assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programming hierarchical self-organization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new preprint with Shunhao Oh and Dana Randall explains how to program simple computational &amp;ldquo;particles&amp;rdquo; of different types to self-organize into corresponding spatial regions that have a given hierarchical structure. The size, shape, and hierarchy of the regions are determined by the particles&amp;rsquo; densities and affinities for particles of different types. Proving that the algorithm works requires new techniques for analyzing the Gibbs distributions of fixed-magnetization models from equilibrium statistical mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New preprint on rattling theory</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dana Randall and I generalize and prove the main claims of an emerging physical theory of nonequilibrium self-organization, called rattling theory, by interpreting its main claims in terms of Markov processes. The result is a principle that relates a local aspect of the dynamics to the global steady state. We apply it to random walks on random graphs, spin-glass dynamics, and models of ant colonies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
