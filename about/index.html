    <div style="text-align: justify;"><p>I&rsquo;m a mathematician and data scientist. I&rsquo;m interested in the relationship between the behavior of individuals and that of the collectives they comprise. Fundamental scientific questions concern the forward direction, such as &ldquo;How do the properties of tissues emerge from those of cells?&rdquo; Grand challenges of engineering concern the reverse, like &ldquo;How should I design an individual robot so that the swarm has desirable collective behavior?&rdquo; These questions feature a rich interplay of statistical, computational, and physical elements, which makes their study difficult and rewarding.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m a Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgia Tech, where I&rsquo;m affiliated with the <a href="https://research.gatech.edu/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute for Data Engineering and Science</a> (IDEaS) and the <a href="https://arc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorithms and Randomness Center</a> (ARC), a Visiting Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Fe Institute</a>, and a Visiting Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the London School of Economics. I spent Spring 2025 as the <a href="https://www.slmath.org/berlekamp-postdoctoral-fellows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlekamp Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.slmath.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a PhD in statistics. Before that, I completed an MSc in theoretical physics from the University of Oxford, an MSc in mathematics from the University of Bristol, and a BS in bioengineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am grateful to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Scholarship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marshall Scholarship</a> for supporting my studies in the UK.</p>
<p>I have nine years of professional experience as a data scientist. From 2015 to 2022, I worked at a clinical machine learning company called Dascena, where I led the research team that developed the first machine learning&ndash;based sepsis alert system to improve patient outcomes in a clinical trial. After Dascena was acquired, I joined <a href="https://www.fortahealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forta Health</a>, a startup that expands access to behavioral therapy for children with autism. In parallel, I led the research team at ProGrid Ventures, a startup that develops algorithms for participating in wholesale electricity markets. I left in 2024, to focus on academic research.</p>
