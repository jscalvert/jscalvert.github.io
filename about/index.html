<section id="section">
    <p>I&rsquo;m interested in the behavior of collectives, like colonies of ants and swarms of robots, which I study using probability theory and data science. In practice, this often involves interacting particle systems, Markov chains, and discrete geometry. Lately, I&rsquo;ve been working on a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2411731121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">principle</a> of nonequilibrium self-organization and investigating how the behavior of a collective depends on the number of its constituents.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m a postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech, supervised by <a href="https://randall.math.gatech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dana Randall</a>. I&rsquo;m affiliated with the Institue for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS) and the Algorithms and Randomness Center (ARC). I&rsquo;m also a visiting postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Fe Institute</a>. I spent Spring 2025 in Berkeley, CA as the Berlekamp postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.slmath.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute</a> (formerly MSRI), during its program on the <a href="https://www.slmath.org/programs/348" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Probability and Statistics of Discrete Structures</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a PhD in statistics. Before that, I completed an MSc in theoretical physics from the University of Oxford, an MSc in mathematics from the University of Bristol, and a BS in bioengineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am grateful to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Scholarship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marshall Scholarship</a> for supporting my studies in the UK.</p>
<p>I have nine years of professional experience as a data scientist. From 2015 to 2022, I worked at a clinical machine learning company called Dascena, where I led the research team that developed the first machine learning&ndash;based sepsis alert system to improve patient outcomes in a clinical trial. After Dascena was acquired, I joined <a href="https://www.fortahealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forta Health</a>, a startup that expands access to behavioral therapy for children with autism. In parallel, I led the research team at ProGrid Ventures, a startup that develops algorithms for participating in wholesale electricity markets. I left in 2024, to focus on academic research.</p>
